# DoubleFragmentViewPager

Horizontal and Vertical ViewPager

## How it works
This library uses fragments to make a ViewPager that can be swipe horizontally and vertically.
You have to provide a class that inherit from BaseChildFragment and that hide its 2 statics methods `public static Fragment newInstance(int horiz, int vert)` and `getVerticalPagerAdapterList(FragmentManager fm)`.
See the samples for more informations.
